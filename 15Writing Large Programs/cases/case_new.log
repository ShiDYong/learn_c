In the example makefile, the targets include the  executable
file ‘edit’,  and  the  object  files  ‘main.o’  and
‘kbd.o’.   The   prerequisites   are   files   such   as
‘main.c’ and ‘defs.h’. In fact, each  ‘.o’  file
is both a target and a prerequisite . Recipes include  ‘cc
-c main.c’ and ‘cc -c kbd.c’.
